`issueFetch` must be executed after `issueLock` and the interval must more then `_issueInterval`
destory the token locked by `rHash`
Only callable by the Owner.
Emits a {LockedState} event.
Parameters:
- `rHash` is the hash of locker

### `destoryLock(bytes32 rHash, uint256 amount, address executor)` (public)



lock caller's `amount` token by `rHash`
Emits a {LockedState} event.
Parameters:

### `destoryUnlock(bytes32 rHash, bytes32 rOrigin)` (public)



Destory `rHash` locked token by origin text `rOrigin`
`destoryUnlock` must be executed after `destoryLock` and the interval must less then `_destoryInterval`
Only callable by the Owner.
Emits a {LockedState} event.
Parameters:
